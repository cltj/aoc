──────────────────────────────────────────────────── Day 19: Not Enough Minerals ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Your scans show that the lava did indeed form obsidian!

The wind has changed direction enough to stop sending lava droplets toward you, so you and the elephants exit the cave. As you do, you
notice a collection of geodes around the pond. Perhaps you could use the obsidian to create some geode-cracking robots and break them 
open?

To collect the obsidian from the bottom of the pond, you'll need waterproof obsidian-collecting robots. Fortunately, there is an 
abundant amount of clay nearby that you can use to make them waterproof.

In order to harvest the clay, you'll need special-purpose clay-collecting robots. To make any type of robot, you'll need ore, which is
also plentiful but in the opposite direction from the clay.

Collecting ore requires ore-collecting robots with big drills. Fortunately, you have exactly one ore-collecting robot in your pack 
that you can use to kickstart the whole operation.

Each robot can collect 1 of its resource type per minute. It also takes one minute for the robot factory (also conveniently from your 
pack) to construct any type of robot, although it consumes the necessary resources available when construction begins.

The robot factory has many blueprints (your puzzle input) you can choose from, but once you've configured it with a blueprint, you 
can't change it. You'll need to work out which blueprint is best.

For example:

     1 │ Blueprint 1:                                                                                                                 
     2 │   Each ore robot costs 4 ore.                                                                                                
     3 │   Each clay robot costs 2 ore.                                                                                               
     4 │   Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.                                                                               
     5 │   Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.                                                                               
     6 │                                                                                                                              
     7 │ Blueprint 2:                                                                                                                 
     8 │   Each ore robot costs 2 ore.                                                                                                
     9 │   Each clay robot costs 3 ore.                                                                                               
    10 │   Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 8 clay.                                                                                
    11 │   Each geode robot costs 3 ore and 12 obsidian.                                                                              

(Blueprints have been line-wrapped here for legibility. The robot factory's actual assortment of blueprints are provided one blueprint
per line.)

The elephants are starting to look hungry, so you shouldn't take too long; you need to figure out which blueprint would maximize the 
number of opened geodes after 24 minutes by figuring out which robots to build and when to build them.

Using blueprint 1 in the example above, the largest number of geodes you could open in 24 minutes is 9. One way to achieve that is:

However, by using blueprint 2 in the example above, you could do even better: the largest number of geodes you could open in 24 
minutes is 12.

Determine the quality level of each blueprint by multiplying that blueprint's ID number with the largest number of geodes that can be 
opened in 24 minutes using that blueprint. In this example, the first blueprint has ID 1 and can open 9 geodes, so its quality level 
is 9. The second blueprint has ID 2 and can open 12 geodes, so its quality level is 24. Finally, if you add up the quality levels of 
all of the blueprints in the list, you get 33.

Determine the quality level of each blueprint using the largest number of geodes it could produce in 24 minutes. What do you get if 
you add up the quality level of all of the blueprints in your list?
